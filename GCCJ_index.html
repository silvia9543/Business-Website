		<div style= "color:#000000;"><strong>The Global Center for Climate Justice is a nonprofit multidisciplinary research and networking think tank dedicated to advancing a more transformative politics that addresses the root causes of the climate crisis and social injustices of all kinds. To achieve this goal, we are focused on popular education, conducting original research, movement networking, consulting and outreach. We take an intersectional approach in our work, analyzing the linkages between class exploitation, systemic racism, gender oppression, and political domination.
		<br><br>
		
		The Center's aim is to synthesize, elevate, and popularize climate justice perspectivies and solutions while helping build movement solidarity as a resource hub. We believe that providing popular-discourse materials on climate justice and supporting the development of globally networked movements are critical next steps to solving the climate crisis.
		
		<br><br>
		We are building out a network of activists, practicioners, and policy people worldwide and our team is continually surveying policy, research, and organizing landscapes for individuals and campaigns to celebrate and support.
